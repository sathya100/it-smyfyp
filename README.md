Quantum Enhanced Drug Ranking System for Comorbid Patients!


Actual Motive of the work:
Current cancer treatment systems often fail to provide personalized drug ranking that consider both the molecular profile of the cancer (such as the specific protein affected) and the patient's co-morbid conditions. This leads to suboptimal treatment choices, increased risk of adverse drug reactions, and compromised patient outcomes. Oncologists and clinical pharmacologists require a comprehensive system that identifies cancer-related drugs based on the patient's cancer-affected protein, evaluates potential drug interactions with medications for co-morbid conditions, and ranks cancer drugs based on efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic factors. Such a system can significantly enhance personalized cancer therapy, support informed decision-making, and improve patient care.
